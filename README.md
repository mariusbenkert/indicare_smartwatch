# INDI Care Project

INDI Care is a project within a module in my university. 

The idea is to support caregivers with a digital solution and provide more freedom and safety for both the patients and the caregivers.

This repository contains the code that should run on a smartwatch. The code for the associated smartphone app can be found [here](https://github.com/mariusbenkert/indicare_smartphone).
